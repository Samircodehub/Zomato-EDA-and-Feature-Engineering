# Feature Engineering â€“ How to Detect and Remove Outliers (with Python Code)
How to detect outliers?
ðŸ‘‰ For Normal distributions: Use empirical relations of Normal distribution.

â€“ The data points which fall below mean-3*(sigma) or above mean+3*(sigma) are outliers.

where mean and sigma are the average value and standard deviation of a particular column.

ðŸ‘‰ For Skewed distributions: Use Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) proximity rule.

â€“ The data points which fall below Q1 â€“ 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR are outliers.

where Q1 and Q3 are the 25th and 75th percentile of the dataset respectively, and IQR represents the inter-quartile range and given by Q3 â€“ Q1.

* Minimum â€“ The minimum value in the data set
* First quartile â€“ The value below which the lower 25% of the data exist
* Median â€“ the value below which the lower 50% of the data exist
* Third quartile â€“ the value below which the lower 75% of the data exist
* Maximum â€“ the maximum value in the data set
